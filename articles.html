        <h2>JUST 1 HOUR OF GAMING MAY IMPROVE ATTENTION</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="subtitle-1">
        <h4>The brain can be affected by just one hour of playing video games, according to a new research.</h4>   
      </div>  
      <img id="img1" src="res/a-man-playing-a-video-game.jpg"/>
      <div class="para1">
        <p>
          The study, which was conducted by scientists from the University of 
          Electronic Science and Technology of China in Chengdu, found that 
          participants, who spent 1 hour playing the video game "League of Legends" 
          experienced changes in brain activity.
          <span id="dots"></span>
          <span id="more">
            The participants also demonstrated improved ability 
            to focus on relevant information while screening out distractions.
            The researchers recruited 29 male students to participate in the study. 
            One group had at least 2 years of playing action video games and the other group 
            had fewer than 6 months of experience playing these video games.
            </br> </br>
            The group with the most experience, or the "experts," were ranked in the top 7 percent 
            of League of Legends players. The "non-experts," meanwhile, were ranked in the bottom 11 percent.
            The players' "visual selective attention" was assessed by the 
            researchers before and after playing League of Legends.
            </br> </br>
            Visual selective attention is how scientists refer to the brain's ability 
            to focus while simultaneously disregarding less relevant information.
            Focusing on relevant information in this way uses up brain power, 
            so scientists tend to believe that people who are very good at focusing 
            their attention while filtering out distractions show a very efficient use of their brains.
            </br> </br>
            First, participants were briefly shown a square in the center of the screen,
            which was followed by a square flashing elsewhere on the screen. 
            The participants had to then tell the scientists where on the screen the second square was,
            relative to the first square.
            The participants' brain activity was also monitored during the visual selective attention test
            using an electroencephalogram (EEG) machine.
            </br> </br>
            Before playing the video game, the expert participants were found
            to have stronger visual selective attention than the non-experts, 
            and their EEG results showed more attention-related brain activity.
            </br> </br>
            After playing League of Legends for 1 hour, both groups demonstrated improved visual selective attention,
            even reporting similar scores in the post-game test.
            Not only that, but the researchers found that the brain activity of the non-experts increased after playing the game,
            to the extent that levels of brain activity between experts and non-experts were now comparable.

          <h2>PLAYING VIDEO GAMES MAY 'ENHANCE LEARNING'</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle-2">
          <h4>In a learning test, people who play video games performed better than those who don't, 
              and their brains appeared to be more active in regions linked to learning and memory.</h4>
        </div>
        <img id="img2" src="res/boy playing.jpg">
        <div class="para-2">
          <p>
            The researchers explain that recent studies have suggested that playing
            video games may benefit cognition. However, the brain mechanisms 
            involved are poorly understood.
            <span id="dots2"></span>
            <span id="more2">
            They focused on "a widely unexplored area in gaming research" called
            "probabilistic category learning." This type of learning concerns acquiring and classifying knowledge
            and using it to predict future events.A traditional way of testing probabilistic category learning is 
            the so-called weather prediction task, which researchers use to gain "insight into implicit forms of learning, 
            cognitive flexibility, and the use of feedback signals in the brain."
            </br> </br>
            For their investigation, the team recruited 17 video gamers and 17 non-gamers. 
            They recruited the video gamers on the basis that they spent at least 15 hours per week playing action-based video games.
            The non-gamers either did not play at all or did so only infrequently.
            </br> </br>
            Both groups played the weather prediction task. As they completed it, the researchers used MRI to record their brain activity.
            To complete the task, the participants had to look at three cue cards with different patterns on them 
            and then predict the weather. They were asked, "Will there be sun or rain?" 
            They were then told straight away whether their answer was right or wrong.
            As each card is only a partially accurate predictor of the weather, 
            the correct answer is determined by the probability predicted by the combination.
            </br> </br>
            The study's findings are likely to be significant not only for young people, but also for older generations, 
            because reduction in memory is linked to changes in the hippocampus.
            "Maybe we can treat that with video games in the future," suggests Schenk.

          <h2>BRAIN TRAINING GAMES 'DO NOT BOOST COGNITION'</h2>
        </div> 
        <div class="subtitle-3">
          <h4>A recent study that measured brain activity, decision-making, and cognitive ability found that playing commercial
              brain games offered no benefits above those of playing online video games.</h4>
        </div>
        <img id="img3" src="res/shirt.jpg">
        <div class="para-3">
          <p>
            In a report on the research that is published in The Journal of Neuroscience,
            researchers from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia conclude that commercial brain games 
            appear to have no effect on cognitive function and decision-making beyond the tasks included in the game.
            <span id="dots3"></span>
            <span id="more3">
              The study was co-led by Joseph Kable, an associate professor of psychology in the School of Arts & Sciences, 
              and Caryn Lerman, a professor in cancer research and the vice dean
              for Strategic Initiatives in the Perelman School of Medicine.
              The researchers were looking for ways to help people improve their ability to make decisions 
              that do not lead to unhealthy habits such as smoking and overeating.
              </br> </br>
              Because of the claims made by commercial brain-training games, the team wondered
              if playing them might improve decision-making.The researchers note that people with stronger cognitive ability
              tend to be less impulsive when making decisions that involve a choice between
              an immediate, small reward and a delayed, larger reward.
              </br> </br>
              Also, previous work led by Prof. Lerman had established that engaging brain regions that are important for self-control,
              or executive function, can bias choices away from those that bring immediate reward, such as smoking.
              Brain-training games, such as the one used in the study, include tasks that likely engage the same brain structures - namely,
              the dorsolateral prefrontal area of the brain - as those that are active in these types of executive function decisions.
              </br> </br>
              However, the researchers explain that previous studies of commercial brain-training games - which they refer to as "cognitive training" games 
              - have yielded mixed conclusions about whether the improvements that players achieve from practicing the games "transfer beyond trained tasks."
              They therefore decided to carry out a first-of-its-kind randomized controlled trial to compare the effects
              on brain activity and decision-making of playing a commercial cognitive training game, 
              with those of playing standard online video games.
